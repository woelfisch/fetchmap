# TODO

  - Improve error handling, i.e. terminate with a meaningful message instead
    of a backtrace when something goes wrong
  - Fix collision detection to avoid labels running into town markers
  - Support overlay tiles
  - Render own tiles... JUST KIDDING!
  - But maybe support Natural Earth base maps instead of tiles?
